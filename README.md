Details of the Portal :

The 'Brain Opener's E Learning Portal' has a dual level structure - Teacher level and Student level
Only authorised teachers can log in, create the study material and create or modify the question bank for quiz . (Data-security)
Similarly, a student can also create an account, view the study material and take a quiz on whichever chapters he desires.
A special feature of the quiz is that the teacher can mark the difficulty level of a question as 'Easy', 'Medium' and 'Difficult' so that all the students get the same level of questions, though the questions being randomly selected.
